# HW 2: From Notebooks to Research Packages

_This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Fall 2025 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science](https://ucb-stat-159-f25.github.io/site/). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration._

In this repository, I replicated the original LIGO tutorial and made a small fix for a SciPy version incompatibility (`scipy.signal` vs. `scipy.signal.windows` in newer releases).

To ensure reproducibility, I also set up a Binder environment so the analysis can be run directly in the proper environment:
